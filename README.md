# music-player
<p>
A simple music player web app, which will play songs, which I've already feeded in them. Will try to connect it to API soon. 
Right now, a basic music player with bare minimum features.
Made to get more comfortable with Javascript and its operations. <br><br>
(Javascript code is in the script tag!)
